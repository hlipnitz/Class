		<h1>Our Mission</h1>
		<p>Our sweet little cafe serves organic, healthy cuisine for the healthier taste palette, in a quaint, calming environment. The cuisine is presented to you on our simple dishware in a manor that will still make your tastebuds water. Our dishes are affordable for its healthier state, and is perfect for a nice brunch with the girls. We serve our guests Tuesday to Saturday from 11:30 am until 9 pm. We also serve brunch on Sundays from 8 am until 2 pm.</p>
		<p>We are located in Medford, NJ, in a small storefront just off of Stokes Road, adding to our hidden-gem charm. The atmosphere keeps visitors in a calm, comfortable state of mind while being in quite a small location. We remain unique to our visitors with our feminine charm and unique organic food choices. Our clientele include local and visiting people, mostly the women of this area, but we are always child-friendly. Alcohol is not provided by our cafe, but a BYOB policy is set for those adults who enjoy wine and beer with our dishes. All are welcome at the Zinc Cafe.</p>
		<p>Our competition is always close by, being surrounded by pizzerias and fast food locations, such as McDonalds and Riveria pizza. There are also chains like PJ Whelihans in our area. But we have kept our cafe alive for the past 4 years with healthier, organic choices that beat out the less-than-healthy pizzerias.</p>
